# NASW - Wayland Audio Switcher

WARNING — LLM‑GENERATED CODE
----------------------------
This **project was generated entirely with large language models** and "vibe coded" _by a person who does not know or understand the Rust programming language_ (or any other programming language). It was produced over the course of dozens of prompts and back-and-forth conversations using Claude.ai Sonnet 4.5 and later refactored with Opus 4.5 models.

Important points:
- The code is **100% LLM generated** and was not written by an experienced Rust developer.
- It has <ins>**NOT** been peer reviewed</ins> by anyone with Rust experience (not even a beginner).
- While I am confident the program works as intended and there is no malicious code, use with caution.
- [Discussions](https://github.com/ledati16/nasw/discussions) are left open on this repository for community review and feedback. If you want to confirm the code is harmless and functional or have reviewed it yourself, please check/post there.
- I consider this program feature-complete for my personal needs and do not intend to maintain or fix bugs.
- If you want to maintain this project, please consider forking and renaming it (and possibly linking back to this page).
- _You should NOT package or distribute this program for Linux distributions (including AUR-like PKGBUILDs) unless a peer review by someone experienced in Rust confirms it is safe and functional._

This project is a niche, unreviewed tool similar in spirit to [Belphemur/SoundSwitch](https://github.com/Belphemur/SoundSwitch) but targeted at Wayland compositors + PipeWire.

Project Overview
----------------
**NASW** is a small command-line/daemon utility that automatically switches PipeWire audio sinks based on active windows reported by Wayland compositors using standard protocols.

- Automatic sink switching based on matching window rules (app_id and optional title regex).
- Per-rule notifications (via notify-rust) when switches occur (configurable).
- Support for "profile switching" for sinks that require changing device profiles (uses pw-cli).
- Uses PipeWire native tools:
  - _pw-dump_ to discover current objects and sinks,
  - _pw-metadata_ to set the default sink,
  - _pw-cli_ to switch device profiles.
- Maintains a tracked set of "active" windows that matched rules; when those windows close or stop matching, NASW returns to the next appropriate sink (most recently opened matching window has priority; fallback is configured default).
- One-shot CLI operations:
  - _--check-config_: Validate configuration and show summary
  - _--list-sinks_: Discover available audio outputs (including those that require profile switching)
  - _--set-sink_: Change the default sink - smart toggle (back-and-forth) supported
  - _--next-sink_ / _--prev-sink_: Cycle configured sinks
  - _--get-sink_: Show current configured sink (JSON option for status bars)
- JSON output options for integration with status bars (includes icons).
- Configuration via a TOML file (default created under XDG config dir: nasw/config.toml). Settings support toggles for notifications, smart toggle behavior, reset on startup, and log level.
- Connects to Wayland compositors via standard window management protocols (see below).
- Logging with tracing and configurable log level.

Supported Compositors
---------------------
NASW uses standard Wayland protocols for window management, which means it works with multiple compositors without compositor-specific code:

### Via wlr-foreign-toplevel-management protocol:
- **Sway** - i3-compatible tiling compositor
- **Hyprland** - Dynamic tiling compositor
- **Niri** - Scrollable-tiling compositor
- **River** - Dynamic tiling compositor
- **Wayfire** - 3D Wayland compositor
- **labwc** - Openbox-inspired stacking compositor
- **dwl** - dwm for Wayland
- **hikari** - Stacking compositor with workspace groups

### Via plasma-window-management protocol:
- **KDE Plasma (KWin)** - KDE's window manager

### Not Supported:
- **GNOME/Mutter** - Does not expose window management protocols to clients

**Why Wayland protocols?**  
Instead of using compositor-specific IPC (like Niri's Unix socket or Sway's i3-ipc), NASW uses standardized Wayland protocols that are supported by many compositors. This provides broader compatibility with less code.

Limitations & Requirements
--------------------------
- Requires a Wayland compositor that supports either `wlr-foreign-toplevel-management` or `plasma-window-management` protocol
- Requires PipeWire to be running and pw-* utilities (pw-dump, pw-metadata, pw-cli) to be available on PATH
- Uses desktop notifications via notify-rust (may require a running notification daemon on the host)
- Because the code was generated by LLMs and has not been peer reviewed, it may contain bugs or incorrect assumptions. Use on a non-critical machine or inside a container until validated

Example configuration
---------------------
Found at _$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nasw/config.toml_ (usually ~/.config/nasw/config.toml). This is the default config used by the program if none exists.

```toml
# NASW (Niri Audio Switcher) Configuration
#
# Uses PipeWire native tools for audio control.
# Supports profile switching for analog/digital outputs.

[settings]
reset_on_startup = true    # Reset to default sink on daemon start
smart_toggle = true        # --set-sink toggles back to default if already active
notify_daemon = true       # Notifications for daemon start/stop
notify_switch = true       # Notifications for rule-triggered switches (per-rule notify must also be true)
notify_set = true          # Notifications for --set-sink, --next-sink, and --prev-sink commands
status_bar_icons = false   # If true, custom icons only apply to --get-sink --json
log_level = "info"         # error, warn, info, debug, trace

# Audio sinks
# Find available sinks with: nasw --list-sinks
#
# Icons are auto-detected from sink description (e.g., "HDMI" → video-display).
# Set 'icon' to override with any icon name your system supports.

[[sinks]]
name = "alsa_output.pci-0000_0c_00.4.iec958-stereo"
desc = "Optical Out"
icon = "audio-speakers"
default = true

[[sinks]]
name = "alsa_output.pci-0000_0c_00.4.analog-stereo"
desc = "Headphones"
icon = "audio-headphones"

# Window rules
# Find app_id and title with compositor-specific tools:
#   Sway/River/etc: swaymsg -t get_tree
#   Hyprland: hyprctl clients
#   Niri: niri msg windows
#   KDE: qdbus org.kde.KWin /KWin org.kde.KWin.showDebugConsole (shows app_id)
#
# Or use a Wayland inspector like wlr-randr or similar tools
#
# Regex patterns (for app_id and title fields):
#   "firefox"     - matches anywhere in string
#   "^steam$"     - exact match only
#   "^(mpv|vlc)$" - matches mpv OR vlc
#   "(?i)discord" - case insensitive

[[rules]]
app_id = "^steam$"
title = "^Steam Big Picture Mode$"
sink = "Optical Out"       # Reference by: desc, name, or position (1, 2)
desc = "Steam Big Picture" # Custom name for notifications
notify = true

# [[rules]]
# app_id = "^mpv$"
# sink = 2
# notify = true
```

Building the program
--------------------
Prerequisites:
- A working Rust toolchain (stable). Cargo.toml sets rust-version = "1.70" — a modern stable toolchain is recommended.
- PipeWire and the pw-* utilities (pw-dump, pw-metadata, pw-cli) available on PATH for full functionality.
- A supported Wayland compositor (see "Supported Compositors" section above) and a notification daemon for desktop notifications.

Typical build steps:
1. Install Rust toolchain (if needed):
   - curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   - rustup default stable

2. Build in release mode:
   - cargo build --release

3. The built binary will be at:
   - target/release/nasw
   - Or, if you install with cargo install --path . it will go to ~/.cargo/bin/nasw

Running
-------
- One-shot commands (no daemon):
  - List sinks: ```nasw --list-sinks```
  - Check config: ```nasw --check-config```
  - Set sink: ```nasw --set-sink "Headphones"```
  - Get current: ```nasw --get-sink```
  - Cycle sinks: ```nasw --next-sink``` / ```nasw --prev-sink```

- Daemon mode (monitors window events and switches audio automatically):
  - Simply run: ```./target/release/nasw```
  - The daemon will automatically connect to your Wayland compositor
  - Requires a compositor that supports wlr-foreign-toplevel or plasma-window-management protocol

Notes
-----
- If no config exists, the program will generate the default config at $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nasw/config.toml.
- Use ```nasw --list-sinks``` to discover active sinks and profile-switch-only sinks before editing your config.
- Because this repository is LLM-generated and not peer-reviewed, test carefully and prefer non-critical environments until validated.
